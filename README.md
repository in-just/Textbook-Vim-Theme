# Textbook-Vim-Theme
## A minimal Vim theme

The philosophy behind this theme was to keep it as minimal as possible. 
I personally find modern syntax themes to be too intrusive with the excessive use of colors. 

Since I use this theme everyday you can expect it to be updated regularly. If you decide to copy/fork it please feel free to send me a message letting me know. It is encouraging whenever someone likes my themes.
