## A minimal Vim theme

This is my Vim theme. There are many like it but this one is mine.

The philosophy behind this theme was to keep it as minimal as possible. 

Since I use this theme everyday you can expect it to be updated regularly. If you decide to copy/fork it please feel free to send me a message letting me know. It is encouraging whenever someone likes my themes.
